                <br>
                <p class="aboutMeText">To prepare myself for opportunities I have developed many side projects and attended hackathons. Through this not only did I enhance my communication and programming skills, but also learned how to work with a team to develop projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="aboutMeText">The majority of my work has been front-end development. Such as developing websites with HTML and CSS, and developing android application layouts. 
                    <br><br>
                    While I have yet to have an internship, I am open to learning new things and will strive to be a valuable asset to your team.</p>

                        HoloENClipper was my first website-related project. The reason for this project was because I wanted to learn how to develop websites. While learning how to develop websites, I brought my hobby into it which is Hololive.
                        <br><br>
                        Hololive is a Japanese virtual Youtuber talent agency. Virtual YouTubers are entertainers that live stream, often streaming games or singing. They also use a virtual avatar to display themselves, which makes them virtual YouTubers.
                        <br><br>

                        The website provides buttons for Hololive English's members as well as tags which are popular jokes within the community. The website then searches the tags inputted by the user using the YouTube API.
                        <br><br>

                        The website will then display a video retrieved from the Youtube API at the bottom of the website.

                        <br><br>
                        I worked on developing some of the screens in the app, in addition to making custom adapters. I also worked on connecting the different screens of the app, allowing data to be passed through each screen.
                        <br><br>
                        From this, I learned how to make custom adapters, which are similar to objects. They allow multiple types of data to be displayed in a component. In addition, learned how to use Github To cooperatively develop a project.

                    <p class="description">This project was made during Team Liquid's first Hackathon, Liquid Hacks. Team Liquid is a professional esports organization based in the Netherlands. 
                        <br><br>
                        With this in mind, my team decided to make a notification app that will remind you when various E-sport games are about to start. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our app uses the Pandascore API, which provides the information for e-sport matches. Then displays the information corresponding to each game, the two teams playing, the names and logos of the two teams, and the date of the match. 
                        <br><br>
                        After subscribing to the match the app will send you a notification when the match is about to start.</p>

                        <br><br>
                        As a result of this, I decided to start using a to-do list. However, when I searched for basic to-do list apps in the app store, many of them were paid apps that I did not want to spend my money on. 
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, I wanted to expand my knowledge in the CS field so I took an online course on Android Development. 
                        <br><br>
                        Resulting from these two factors I decided to incorporate the two and developed a To-Do List app through Android Studio. </p>

                        <br><br>
                        However, In addition to following instructions, I added my own additional features to the website. Furthermore, I also completed all the optional given as an assignemnt.

                    <p class = "description">This game was made with the Unity game engine. 
                        <br><br>
                        I worked on the Majority of the above-water portion of the game, the layout of the scene, the character's animations,  and the movement of the characters.
                       <br><br>
                        The art for the scene and characters were not made by me, they were free models on the Unity store.

                    <p class = "description">This project is a game developed by a hackathon team and I, where the goal is for the user to go into the ocean to pick up trash drifting in the water. 
                        <br><br>
                        Through this game, we wish to bring awareness to the players about the amount of debris in the ocean and encourage them to help clean up the ocean.</p>

                    <p class="description">This game was inspired by a previous game that my group members did call wastelands. For this game, we decided that we all are going to do something new and try to make a game with Unity. 
                        <br><br>
                        All of us had no experience in Unity. However, I am proud that we completed the game in under 24 hours while learning something completely new.</p>
