                <P>Hololive is a virtual YouTuber talent agency based in Japan, virtual Youtubers usually Livestream, playing games while interacting with their viewers. Most of Hololive's talents are predominantly Japanese, and they don't speak much English. However, that did not change the fact that they have millions of fans overseas and in America. As a result of this, Hololive decided to debut a new generation, Hololive EN. These streamers having their wonderful personalities while speaking English, allowed their popularity to skyrocket with all five members nearing 1 million YouTube subscribers in under a year.</P>

                <p>Holo EN Clipper is a website made by another developer and I. The website is designed to play a clip of Hololive EN members in, correspondence to selected tags inputted by the user. This was made through the use of a YouTube API, searching the inputted tags, and then changing the video at the bottom. I mostly worked on the front end, implementing the HTML and CSS and also the button system. My partner worked on the backend getting the selected buttons and changing the iframe at the bottom.</p>

                        The first project I have done outside of course work and was made by another developer and I. This is a simple to-do list through Android Studio using java. I worked on the app layouts and interactions between different activities.
                        <br><br>
                        Stay productive through the use of this to-do list app that keeps track of what you need to do. Not only does it help you stay productive, but it also keeps you organized by sorting your tasks using a tag System. You can make your own tags or use the default tags like recurring. Once a task is completed simply tap on the task and it will fade out, pushing it to the bottom of the list.
                        <br><br> Completed tasks will automatically delete themselves unless they're assigned a reoccurring tag which will uncheck them at the end of the day.

                <p>Esports Lookout was a project that my team and I did for the Liquid Hacks hackathon. A 36-hour hackathon hosted by <a href="https://www.teamliquid.com/" target="_blank">Team Liquid</a> on November 6-8, 2020. I worked on the front end, design of the layouts as well as working with backend to incorperate the two.
                    <br><br>This app is a reminder app that allows you to keep track of multiple E sports games. The games we took into consideration was League Of Legends, CS GO, and Valorant. At the time of creation Overwatch was on offseason so it was not taken into consideration.

                    <p>After clicking on the desired game, the app will list professional E-sport matches sorted by upcoming dates. This was done using padascore API. After subscribing to a match it will then be added to the subscribed matches list. Where you can keep track of the games that interest you. Furthermore, the app will send you a notification when matches are about to start in case you forgot about them.
