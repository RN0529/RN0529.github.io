            <P>
                The first project I have done outside of course work and was made by another developer and I. This is a simple to do list through Android Studio using java.
                <br><br>Stay productive by using a to do list app that keeps track of  what you need to do , while keeping you organized sorting your tasks using a tag system. Once the task is completed simply tap the task and it will fade out and be pushed to the bottom of the list.
                <br><br> Completed tasks will automatically delete themselves unless they're assigned a reoccurring tag which will  uncheck them at the end of the day.

            <p>Liquid Lookout was a project that my team and I did for the Liquid Hacks hackathon. A 36-hour hackathon hosted by <a href="https://www.teamliquid.com/" target="_blank">Team Liquid</a> on November 6-8, 2020.
                <br><br> My group and I made an app called, Liquid Lookout. This app is basically a reminder app that allows you to keep track of multiple E sports games. The games we took into consideration was League Of Legends, CS GO, and Valorant. At the time of creation Overwatch was on offseason so it was not taken into consideration.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="projects">
            <p>After Clicking on the decided games, the app will tell you the games that will take place sorted by the next upcoming match. This is done using pandascore api. After subscribing to a match it will then be placed in a subscribed matches list where you are able to keep track of the games that interest you. Furthermore the app will send you a notification when matches are about to start just incase you forget about them.
